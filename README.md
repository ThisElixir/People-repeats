# People-repeats

As people get older and history is recorded, it has been noticed that human behavior is not totally random, we seem to have similar skills and weaknesses as all the characters from stories fictional or not, we can identify with their struggles and pleasures, we see ourselves and our friends on them, our enemies in others, regardless of why this happens, many cultures have noticed though time and divided the people in categories based on the way they behave, systems like Kabbalah, the Zodiac, Tarot, have all been accurately describing some people for thousands of years, they seem to be able to tell more of a person than just what one may learn based on a couple of facts about them, when one of the patterns fits a personal characteristic, it seems to fit on the others as well.
Those systems are not 100% accurate all the time with everybody, because they are tainted with the superstition and politics of the time they were developed, setting the noise aside and looking at it scientifically, we see more clearly every day the patterns that have been revealed by the ancient knowledge.
Since the 1900s behavior pattern prediction has been improving. Systems like MBTI, ENEAGRAM, and THE FIVE PREFERENCES are very popular with current psychologists for work environments and has become an obsession for some internet communities because of its accuracy. On its current state, the science of categorizing and predicting the behavior of people with the current systems allows us to:
-Create relatable characters on stories that people Identify with and want to see
 -Help people understand themselves and others 
-Position a person on a role that best suits their natural skills and defects 
-Predict or manage relationships between individuals and groups for good or bad
When a person learns the basic behavior patterns and they can categorize others and themselves, also become able to:
-Manage people to improve or diminish their personality advantages over others to some extent, this improves in accuracy as more information is received. 
-Predict other people's reaction to themselves and others, also explain the past behavior. 
-Exploit weaknesses or empower abilities people may or may not be aware they have.
